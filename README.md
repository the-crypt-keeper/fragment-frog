# üê∏ FragmentFrog

FragmentFrog is a React application designed to help users write, edit, and revise stories, documents, emails, or any other text quickly with keyboard shortcuts and AI assistance.

## Concepts

- **Fragment**: A small piece of text, usually but not necessarily a sentence.
- **Fragment list**: A list of fragments that, when joined together, forms the current document.
- **Selected fragment**: The index of the currently selected fragment in the list.
- **Document**: The fragment list joined into a single string without introducing any additional whitespace.
- **Mode**: The current editor mode: "explore" (default), "edit", or "insert".

## Keyboard Controls

### Explore Mode (Default)
- Left/Right Arrows: Change selected fragment
- Space: Edits selected fragments
- 'i': Insert a new fragment after selected fragment
- 'd': Deletes the selected fragment

### Edit/Insert Mode
- Ctrl+Enter: Insert a newline
- Enter: Save changes and return to explore mode
- Escape: Discard changes (edit mode) or delete inserted fragment (insert mode) and return to explore mode
